# Java Lab Practicals

## Programs

### 1. Program to find the transpose of a matrix.

### 2. Write a Java program to read a matrix and find the largest and smallest value in the matrix and interchange their positions.

### 3. To check which one is executed first, static block or static method.

### 4. Above given same programs in menu-driven format:
   a. To remove all adjacent duplicates from a string.  
   b. To reverse each word in a string.  
   c. Program to create and use string class methods.  
   d. Develop a palindrome checker application using the Java String.  

### 5. Above given same programs in menu-driven format:
   a. To find the number of elements in an array.  
   b. To find the 2nd largest and smallest element in an array.  
   c. To remove duplicate elements from an array.  
   d. Search key element in an array.  
   e. To count the number of occurrences of an element in an array.  

### 6. Create a class `Employee` (int Empid, String name, String Designation) with two subclasses:
   - **Permanent** (double BP, double GP, double NP)
   - **Temporary** (double Salary_per_hour, double Total_hours, double Total_salary)  
   Calculate GP and NP for permanent employees. For temporary employees, calculate Total_salary.  

### 7. Develop an `Employee` class with attributes name, empid, and date of joining. Include a constructor to initialize the instance variables. Create employee objects and sort them based on name in alphabetical order.

### 8. Develop a Java Program to create an abstract class named `Shape` that contains two integers and an empty method named `printArea()`. Provide three classes named `Rectangle`, `Triangle`, and `Circle` that extend the class `Shape`. Each class should implement the `printArea()` method to print the area of the shape.

### 9. Program to access superclass constructor and variable.

### 10. Java program to use the `this` keyword in inheritance.

### 11. Explain the final keyword with inheritance.

### 12. Create a class called `Vehicle` and a class called `Car` which extends `Vehicle`. Illustrate overloading and overriding using the relationship between the classes.

### 13. Create a Java class `Student` with attributes name, age, and rollNumber. Implement constructor overloading to initialize objects with different combinations of attributes.

### 14. Write a Program to Display the Result of a Student Using Multi-Level Inheritance: 
   - Class One - To Receive Inputs  
   - Class Two - To Process  
   - Class Three - To Display the Output  

### 15. Program to show the implementation of an interface.

### 16. Create an abstract class `BankAccount` with abstract methods `deposit()` and `withdraw()`. Implement two subclasses `SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount` that extend the `BankAccount` class and provide their own implementations. In the main method, create instances of both account types and perform deposits and withdrawals.

### 17. Implementation of user-defined package.

### 18. Java program to handle exceptions using Try and multiple catch blocks.

### 19. The `Citizen` class should have the following attributes: name, id, country, sex, maritalStatus, annualIncome, and economyStatus. Validate the fields; if the age is below 18 and the country is not ‘India’, throw `NonEligibleException` and provide a proper message. Use separate classes for Exception and application.

### 20. Write a program to input the name and balance of a customer and trigger a user-defined exception if the balance is less than 1000.

### 21. Program to create multiple threads by implementing an interface.

### 22. Write a Java program that creates a class extending `Thread` to print numbers from 1 to 10 in a separate thread. Run the thread and display the numbers.

### 23. Write a Java program that extends the `Thread` class to create two threads. One thread should print even numbers from 2 to 20, and the other thread should print odd numbers from 1 to 19.

### 24. Explain the `yield()` and `sleep()` method in the Thread class. Write a program that uses the `sleep()` method to simulate delay in threads.

### 25. Write a Java program to create an ArrayList of integers, add five elements to it, and then display the elements. Also, sort the list in ascending order and display the sorted list (using collections).

### 26. Develop a GUI application that receives an integer in one text field and computes its factorial value, returning it in another text field when the button named “compute” is clicked.
